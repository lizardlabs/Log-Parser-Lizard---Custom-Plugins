In case that out-of-the box parsers canâ€™t read the complex data files, custom .NET plugins in Visual Basic .Net or C# can be created. 

This is the repository with some samples. If you are interested, you can build and add your own samples here.

## Content:

- SurveyGizmoResponseReader.vb - read SurveyGizmo JSON v5 API Response into flat table to query with SQL
- Various Samples:
  - DatesTable.vb - This sample is similar to "Dates Table Input Format" to fill table of dates and its properties
